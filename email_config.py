            üö® WEED DETECTION ALERT üö®

            Our AI-powered Rice Weed Detection System has identified weeds in your rice crop.

            üìç Farm Location: {farm_location}
            üïê Detection Time: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}

            üìà Confidence Level: {confidence:.1%}
            ‚ö†Ô∏è  Status: IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

            üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
            ‚Ä¢ Inspect the affected areas immediately
            ‚Ä¢ Apply appropriate weed control measures
            ‚Ä¢ Monitor crop health closely over the next few days
            ‚Ä¢ Consider consulting with agricultural experts
            ‚Ä¢ Document the affected areas for future reference

            ‚è∞ URGENCY LEVEL: HIGH
            Early intervention is crucial to prevent crop damage and ensure optimal yield.
            Weeds can spread rapidly and compete with rice plants for nutrients and water.

            üìû SUPPORT:
            If you need assistance with weed identification or treatment recommendations,
            please contact our agricultural support team.
